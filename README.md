## Overview

### The challenge

The  challenge is to build out this advice generator app using the Advice Slip API and get it looking as close to the design as possible. 

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS


### What I learned

I practiced my Frontend skills by adding the code to this challenge and the JS functions to make this work with the API advice generator, it was a bit challenging on getting the right formula in JS and after web search I managed to get it right and connected. 



### Continued development

Another challenge I faced was that one of my Chrome extensions was blocking the JS functions and it wasn't generating any advises, I managed to find the root cause and disable the extension. I think that this challenge was within my knowledge scope and besides this, no other challenges were found. 


### Useful resources

- [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Wo_rj2dhkw) - This helped me to corroborate my JS code but eventually I noticed that was the extension causing the error.
- [Mockup website](https://www.ls.graphics/free-mockups) - I used the mockup from here, make sure you have adobe Photoshop or Adobe XD as is required to edit the mockup.

## Acknowledgments
I would say the youtuber tsbsankara as I was able to compare my JS code with him to make sure it was correct.
