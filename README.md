## Overview

### The challenge

This challenge will be perfect practice for anyone wanting to test their CSS Grid skills. Grid is such a powerful addition to CSS, so it's worth getting to grips with it! 
The main challenge is to build out this testimonials grid section and get it looking as close to the design as possible. 

Users should be able to:
1. View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
